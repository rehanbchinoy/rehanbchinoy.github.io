### Introduction

This post is clearly long overdue.

My experience at the Life Sciences Summer Institute (in partnership with The Scripps Research Institute and The Salk Institute) in the summer of 2017 was productive and personally meaningful. It spurred my interest in both neuroscience and academic research more broadly, and it was a privilege to be surrounded by such a brilliant community of mentors and peers.

After recently being interviewed by a postdoc at a UCLA neuroscience lab -- and consequently being bombarded with techinical questions about my research experience at Salk -- I feel that it's probably a good idea for me to detail my specific contributions to the research project and the skills I picked up along the way, both for companies/researchers to get a good idea of my skillset and for my own mental organization. 

So, without further ado, let's get into the details.

### LSSI bootcamp in laboratory methods

The first week of the Life Sciences Summer Institute (LSSI) program was a rigorous bootcamp in life-science laboratory methods. It was here that I had my first experience using various lab equipment, such as pipets, pH meters, spectophotometers, etc. I also practiced conventional wet-lab procedures, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). We began each day with a theoretical problem set on the cellular/molecular biology and organic chemistry that undergirds various procedures; after lunch, we took our theoretical knowledge and applied it, following a detailed procedure and recording our hypotheses and data carefully in a lab notebook. The bootcamp was a collaborative space -- I had the opportunity to work with multiple peers on problem sets and mini-labs. Our professor served as both an instructor and a mentor, lecturing on the necessary concepts while helping us through the experiments (and observing strict PPE protocol).

### Overview of Research Project

Because of my nascent interest in neuroscience and a relevant foundation in the life sciences and mathematics, I was paired with the Systems Neurobiology Laboratory (under Dr. Edward Callaway) for a 2-month project. My mentor was Matthew Jacobs, a UCSD graduate with a background in biology; the postdoc leading the project was Euiseok Kim.

### Contributions to the Project

So what were my actual contributions to this project?

### Video Presentation & Poster

At the end of the summer, the entire LSSI cohort each gave a 15-20 minute presentation on their research project. After hours of instruction in PowerPoint and rehearsals in front of LSSI admin, I finally got to present my findings to a crowd of researchers and wealthy donors at the Salk Scholars Symposium. You can find the presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9wlPSK0rc8).

Additionally, I had the opportunity to present my findings at the Symphony at Salk, an annual, world-renowned event that attracts wealthy donors (like Al Gore) and famous scientists. At this event, I presented my work through a poster presentation, giving the guests a general overview of the project and fielding technical questions from (quite) a few domain experts. I've attached a scanned copy of the poster below:
