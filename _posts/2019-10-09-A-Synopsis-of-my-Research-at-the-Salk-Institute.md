### Introduction

This post is clearly long overdue.

My experience at the Life Sciences Summer Institute (in partnership with The Scripps Research Institute and The Salk Institute) in the summer of 2017 was productive and personally meaningful. It spurred my interest in both neuroscience and academic research more broadly, and it was a privilege to be surrounded by such a brilliant community of mentors and peers. Being so close to the Pacific Ocean didn't hurt either.

After recently being interviewed by a postdoc at a UCLA neuroscience lab -- and consequently being bombarded with techinical questions about my research experience at Salk -- I feel that it's probably a good idea for me to detail my specific contributions to the research project and the skills I picked up along the way, both for companies/researchers to get a good idea of my skillset and for my own mental organization. 

So, without further ado, let's get into the details.

### LSSI bootcamp in laboratory methods

The first week of the Life Sciences Summer Institute (LSSI) program was a rigorous bootcamp in life-science laboratory methods. It was here that I had my first experience using various lab equipment, such as pipets, pH meters, spectophotometers, etc. I also practiced conventional wet-lab procedures, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay). We began each day with a theoretical problem set on the cellular/molecular biology and organic chemistry that undergirds various procedures; after lunch, we took our theoretical knowledge and applied it, following a detailed procedure and recording our hypotheses and data carefully in a lab notebook. The bootcamp was a collaborative space -- I had the opportunity to work with multiple peers on problem sets and mini-labs. Our professor served as both an instructor and a mentor, lecturing on the necessary concepts while helping us through the experiments (and observing strict PPE protocol).

### Overview of Research Project

Because of my nascent interest in neuroscience and a relevant foundation in the life sciences and mathematics, I was paired with the Systems Neurobiology Laboratory (under Dr. Edward Callaway) for a 7-week project. My mentor was Matthew Jacobs, a UCSD graduate with a background in biology; the postdoc leading the project was Euiseok Kim.

The project focused on elucidating how neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) communicate with neurons from higher visual areas (V2, V3, etc.). These neuronal projections are important to understand because they carry distinct visual information. The two extreme models for V1 projection neurons were:

1. Solitary projection -- V1 projection neurons project to an individual, specific HVA.
2. Manifold projection -- V1 projection neurons project to multiple HVAs.

There were two distinct methodologies used to determine which model was valid. The first was through using microtome sectioning and traditional microscopy. The second was through using lightsheet microscopy and intrinsic imaging signaling.

In both methodologies, the viral tracer Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTb) was used to quantify the number of connections between cells in V1 and cells in HVAs. CTb is a retrograde tracer, meaning that it travels in the opposite direction compared to a regular neuronal signal. Thus, injections of CTb, along with fluorescent dye, are made into the HVAs of the cortical tissue. The dye is swept up by V1 projection neurons, effectively labelling cells in V1 with the corresponding dye. V1 neurons that project to multiple HVAs showed colocalization of dyes.

Because the data indicated very little colocalization of dye in V1 cells, the initial findings were that the majority of V1 neurons project to a single HVA. This finding affirms the solitary projection paradigm.

### Contributions to the Project

Daily tasks relevant to the course of the project:
- Setting up the microscope and analyzing tissue with imaging software (ImageJ and Imaris)
- Using a brain atlas in conjunction with a software tool to divide cortical tissue into the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs)
- Identifying the relevant fluorescent cells in the various cortical regions for hundreds of samples, and recording the quantities in a lab notebook
- Taking inventory of the lab, restocking solutions, handling dry ice

Skills practiced:
- Sectioning cortical tissue with a microtome
- Staining tissue with fluorescent dye (IHC staining)
- Using a lightsheet microscope in conjunction with software to construct a 3D model of the brain

Tasks completed by my mentor or lab assistants that I observed and took notes on:
- Pefusions of the mouse brain
- Setting up the lightsheet microscope
- Injecting a mouse with the CTb viral tracer
- Creating area maps of the cortical tissue using ISI

### Video Presentation & Poster

At the end of the summer, the entire LSSI cohort each gave a 15-20 minute presentation on their research project. After hours of instruction in PowerPoint and rehearsals in front of LSSI administrators, I finally got to present my findings to a crowd of researchers and wealthy donors at the Salk Scholars Symposium. You can find the presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9wlPSK0rc8).

Additionally, I had the opportunity to present my findings at the Symphony at Salk, an annual, world-renowned event that attracts wealthy donors (like Al Gore) and famous scientists. At this event, I presented my work through a poster presentation, giving the guests a general overview of the project and fielding technical questions from (quite) a few domain experts.
