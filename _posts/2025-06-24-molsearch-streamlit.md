title: MolSearch deployed to Streamlit Cloud

I've extended my proof-of-concept molecular similarity search pipeline discussed in my [previous blog post](https://rehanchinoy.com/2024/03/31/molseek.html) using Streamlit Cloud.

Try it here: [MolSearch](https://molsearch.streamlit.app/).

You can search for molecules similar to any compound by entering its SMILES representation. The database is small since this is intended to be a lightweight search, but I believe it demonstrates the power and utility of this approach. See the source code and more details on [GitHub](https://github.com/rehanbchinoy/MolSearch).
