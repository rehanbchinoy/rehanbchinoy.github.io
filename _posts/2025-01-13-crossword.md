title: Visualizing the NYT Mini Crossword

---
Inspired by a [post from the Observable Team](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/nyt-minis), I created an analysis of New York Times Mini Crossword statistics using JavaScript and the D3 library. I compared my crossword performance against my girlfriend's to see, once and for all, how we stack up head-to-head.

The data includes 3 years of crossword history, from January 2022 to December 2024.
