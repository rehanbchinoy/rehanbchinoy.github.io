title: MolSearch deployed to Streamlit Cloud
published: true

I've extended my proof-of-concept molecular similarity search pipeline discussed in my [previous blog post](https://rehanchinoy.com/2024/03/31/molseek.html) using Streamlit Cloud! Try it here: [MolSearch](https://molsearch.streamlit.app/)

You can search for molecules similar to any compound by entering its SMILES string. The database is small since this is intended to be a lightweight search, but I believe it demonstrates the power of this service. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to [rehanbchinoy@gmail.com](rehanbchinoy@gmail.com)!
