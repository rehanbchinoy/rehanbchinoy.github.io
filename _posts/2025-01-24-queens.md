title: Queens - A Strategic Puzzle Game
published: true
---

I recently built a web-based puzzle called Queens, from LinkedIn games, using Vue.js and Vite. I wanted to try my hand at game design and integration of a project into my website using GitHub Pages, and found that this was a pretty simple gateway project to accomplish both objectives.

The Queens game challenges players to place queens on a chess board so that no queen can attack another queen - a fun and sometimes frustrating way to spend your Sunday morning. This implementation was inspired by [Fotis Adamakis's excellent article](https://fadamakis.com/recreating-queens-game-in-vue-d7e3b3013ccb) on recreating the Queens game in Vue, which I used as a starting point (and admittedly is most of the code). I added a few key features:
- three difficulty level selections (easy, medium, and hard),
- a smart timer that starts only on the first move with pause/resume functionality
- minimal color palette and small stylistic touches
     
You can play the game here: [Queens](https://rehanchinoy.github.io/vue-queens/). The source code is available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/rehanbchinoy/vue-queens) for those interested in the implementation details!
