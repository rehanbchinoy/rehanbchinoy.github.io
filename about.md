Hello! I'm currently an AI/ML Engineer at Froniter Medicines, an pre-clinical drug discovery company in South San Francisco, CA. In 2022, I graduated with a B.S. in applied math and a minor in neuroscience at UCLA. In school, I was a research assistant in the [Buonomano Lab](http://buonomanolab.com) at UCLA, where I trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform timing and short-term memory tasks and analyzed the dynamics of the trained networks. 

In my free time I enjoy doing yoga, playing piano, and playing soccer.
