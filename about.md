title: About

I'm a second-year undergrad studying neuroscience and math at UCLA. I've interned at the [Systems Neurobiology Laboratory](https://callaway.salk.edu/) under the direction of Dr. Edward Callaway at the Salk Institute. 

I'm primarily interested in how physical interactions between neurons can give rise to subjective mental phenomena. In addition, as a proponent of the computational theory of mind, I'm interested in using mathematical models to elucidate the computation that underpins "mental modules" like vision and memory.

I'm currently seeking a research position for the 2019-2020 academic year. You can get in touch via [email](mailto:rehanbchinoy@gmail.com).
