Hi there! Iâ€™m Rehan Chinoy, and this is my personal site, where I write about my research in computational neuroscience and other interesting ideas in cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. Most of the posts I write here are geared towards a general audience; however, the research section details some of my more technical work.

Currently, my main research interest is, broadly speaking, how physical interactions between neurons can give rise to various mental phenomena. For example, which neurons are responsible for you recognizing a C major scale? I'm working to make these types of questions more tractable by focusing on the neural computation of certain aspects of memory and learning (such as temporal processing). To achieve this, I'm utilizing computational methods, such as deep learning models of recurrent neural networks.

My goal here is to explain things simply, but comprehensively. However, I may sometimes be unclear in my reasoning or limited in my domain knowledge; moreover, the nature of science is that it is ever-changing -- models and theories are constantly being updated. As such, please reach out if you think something is not quite right.

## About Me

I'm a second-year undergrad studying applied math and neuroscience at UCLA. Currently, I'm a research assistant in the [Buonomano Lab](https://buonomanolab.com) at UCLA, where I'm training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform time-dependent cognitive tasks and analyzing the dynamics of the network. I've interned at the [Systems Neurobiology Laboratory](https://callaway.salk.edu/) under Dr. Edward Callaway at the Salk Institute. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, watching Coen Brothers' films, and exploring new music.

My resume is [here](rehanbchinoy.github.io/RC_resume.pdf). You can get in touch via [email](mailto:rehanbchinoy@gmail.com).
