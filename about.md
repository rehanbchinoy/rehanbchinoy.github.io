title: About

I'm a second-year undergrad studying neuroscience and math at UCLA. I've interned at the [Systems Neurobiology Laboratory](https://callaway.salk.edu/) under the direction of Dr. Edward Callaway at the Salk Institute. 

I'm primarily interested in how physical interactions between neurons can give rise to subjective mental phenomena. In addition, I'm interested in using mathematical models to elucidate the mechanisms of "mental modules" like vision and memory.
