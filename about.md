I'm a fourth-year undergrad studying applied math and neuroscience at UCLA. Currently, I'm working in the [Buonomano Lab](http://buonomanolab.com) at UCLA, where I'm training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform timing and short-term memory tasks and analyzing the recurrent dynamics of the trained networks. 

In my free time I enjoy doing yoga, playing piano, and playing soccer.
